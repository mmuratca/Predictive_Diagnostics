# 📍 Phase 2 Roadmap — System Health Diagnostics AI Platform

A future-proof expansion plan to evolve this deep learning pipeline into a hybrid AI platform powered by vector search, LLMs, and modern MLOps.

---

## 1. Modularize Codebase
Break down the monolithic script into maintainable components:
- `data_loader.py`: data cleaning, encoding
- `model_builder.py`: LSTM/MLP definitions
- `predictor.py`: validation loop, inference runner
- `explainer.py`: SHAP + LLM explanations

---

## 2. Vector Search & Similarity Retrieval
Embed past device configurations as vectors using model inputs + SHAP. Query using FAISS or Pinecone to find similar historical cases.

---

## 3. LLM-Based Explanation Generator
Use GPT or Claude to convert SHAP + prediction results into human-readable summaries or diagnostic notes.

---

## 4. RAG for Engineering QA
Embed SHAP logs, configs, changelogs into a vector DB. Let engineers query: "Why is DEVICE_12 unstable?" → RAG answers from historical data.

---

## 5. Metrics & MLOps
Track performance via MAE, log runs with MLflow/W&B, test multiple backends (LSTM vs RF vs GNN).

---

## 6. Deployment
Convert model to ONNX or TF Lite. Add CLI: `python diagnose.py --input config.csv`. Deploy on internal tools or IoT gateways.
